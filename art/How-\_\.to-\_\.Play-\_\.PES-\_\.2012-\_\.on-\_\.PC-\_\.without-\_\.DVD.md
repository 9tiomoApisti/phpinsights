If you are a fan of Pro Evolution Soccer 2012 (PES 2012), you might want to play it on your PC without having to insert the DVD every time. This is possible by using a crack that bypasses the SecuROM protection and allows you to run the game without the disc. In this article, we will show you how to download and install the crack, as well as some tips and warnings to keep in mind.

## Step 1: Download the Crack
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the crack file from a reliable source. There are many websites that offer cracks for PES 2012, but some of them might contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer. One of the safest and most popular sources is MegaGames[^1^], which has a section dedicated to game fixes. You can find the crack for PES 2012 v1.03 [here](https://megagames.com/fixes/pro-evolution-soccer-2012-v103-all). Alternatively, you can also use GameCopyWorld[^2^], which has a similar section with various cracks for different versions of PES 2012.
 
## Step 2: Install the Patch
 
Before you apply the crack, you need to make sure that your game is updated to the latest version. The crack we are using is for PES 2012 v1.03, which is the latest official patch released by Konami. You can download the patch from [here](https://www.konami.com/wepes/2012/eu/en/patch/) or use the auto-update feature in the game launcher. The patch will improve the gameplay, fix some bugs and add new features to PES 2012.
 
## Step 3: Copy over the Cracked Content
 
After you have downloaded and installed the patch, you can proceed to copy over the cracked content from the crack file. To do this, you need to extract the crack file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will find a folder called "Crack" inside the extracted file, which contains two files: "pes2012.exe" and "rld.dll". These are the files that will replace the original ones in your game directory. To find your game directory, right-click on the PES 2012 shortcut on your desktop and select "Open file location". Then, copy and paste the two files from the "Crack" folder into your game directory, overwriting the existing ones. You might need to grant administrator permission to do this.
 
## Step 4: Play the Game
 
Now you are ready to play PES 2012 on your PC without DVD. Just double-click on the "pes2012.exe" file in your game directory or use the shortcut on your desktop. The game should launch without asking for a disc or a serial number. You can enjoy all the features and modes of PES 2012 without any limitations.
 
### Tips and Warnings
 
- Make sure you backup your original game files before applying the crack, in case something goes wrong or you want to restore them later.
- Don't allow the game to go online or update itself, as this might cause problems with the crack or trigger an anti-piracy measure. Use a firewall if necessary to block any internet access from the game.
- Support the software developers by buying their games if you like them. Piracy is illegal and unethical, and it can harm the gaming industry.
- Use cracks at your own risk. We are not responsible for any damage or consequences that might result from using them.
